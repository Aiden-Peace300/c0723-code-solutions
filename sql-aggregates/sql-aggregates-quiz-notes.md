## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are some examples of aggregate functions?
  aggregate function is a function in a database management system (DBMS) or data analysis tool that performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single summarized result. These functions are typically applied to a group of rows of data and provide a way to derive useful insights or summary statistics from the data.

  - max() : gets the maximum value in a set of values.
  - sum() : calculates the sum of values.
  - avg() : calculates the average of a set of values.
  - count() : counts rows in a specified table or view.

- What is the purpose of a `group by` clause?
  `GROUP BY` allows us to group rows that have the same values in one or more columns so that we can then perform aggregate functions (like counting, summing, finding averages, or finding the maximum or minimum) on the grouped data. In other words, it helps us summarize and analyze our data more effectively.
