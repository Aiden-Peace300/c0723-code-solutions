## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop?
  The purpose of a loop is to repeatedly execute a
  block of code until a specified condition is satisfied.

  It helps automate repetitive tasks, iterate over collections
  of elements, and control the flow of execution based on certain
  conditions. Loops are essential for efficient and concise
  coding, allowing you to perform operations on multiple items
  without repeating code.

---

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop?
  The purpose of a condition expression in a loop is to determine
  whether the loop should continue or terminate based on a
  specified condition.

---

---

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops?
  In the context of loops, "iteration" refers to each execution cycle of the loop body.
  It represents one pass or repetition of the loop.

---

---

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated?
  In a while loop, the condition expression gets evaluated before each iteration of the loop.

---

---

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The initialization expression of a for loop gets evaluated once before the loop starts executing.

---

---

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  The final expression of a for loop gets evaluated after each iteration of the
  loop, but before the condition expression is checked for the next iteration.

---

---

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated?
  after the the code in the loop runs

---

---

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`?
  The keyword that exits a loop before its condition expression
  evaluates to false is break.

---

---

- What does the `++` increment operator do?
  In JavaScript, the ++ increment operator is used to increment the
  value of a variable by 1. It is a shorthand notation for adding 1
  to a variable.

---

---

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object?
  For...in loop: You can use a for...in loop to iterate over the
  enumerable properties of an object, including its keys.

## Notes

1. use a while loop when you do not know when it ends
2. use for loop when you know when to stop

3. 'debugger' keyword will stop on the line its written and in the source tab of the broswer you can step through the logic step by step

All student notes should be written here.
