## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- Why do two div elements "vertically stack" on one another by default?
  By default, two `div` elements (or any block-level elements) stack on top of each other vertically because their default CSS display property value is block. A block-level element generates a block box, which means it takes up the full width available and starts on a new line, creating a vertical stacking effect.

- What is the default `flex-direction` of an element with `display: flex`?
  The default `flex-direction` of an element with `display: flex` is ROW.

- What are the three primary components of a page layout? (Which helper classes do you need?)

  1. rows
  2. columns 
  3. containers

- What is the minimum number of **columns** that you should put in a **row**?
  The minimum number of columns in a row is NOT fixed and can vary based on design and content requirements.

- What is the purpose of a **container**?
  Containers enable the creation of well-organized, maintainable, and responsive layouts that enhance the overall user experience.

  Containers can take various forms, such as <div> elements, semantic HTML elements like <section> and <article>, or specific container elements provided by CSS frameworks. Additionally, CSS layout systems like Flexbox and CSS Grid use containers to define the layout and positioning of elements on a page.
