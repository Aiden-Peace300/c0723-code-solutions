## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to
  perform a particular task.

---

---

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  Implementing the 'function' keyword. An optional name
  ( this is also because it can be anonymous ). A list of
  parameters names enclosed in parentheses. The statement
  enclosed in braces.

---

---

- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  type the name of function that you would like to call with
  the appropriate arguments with the () parentheses

---

---

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A function must be called for the code within its code block to run.
  while defining a function does not cause the code in its code block to be run

---

---

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
  An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.

---

---

- Why are function **parameters** useful?
  A function can take parameters which are just values you supply to the function so
  that the function can do something utilising those values. These parameters are
  just like variables except that the values of these variables are defined
  when we call the function and are not assigned values within the function itself.

---

---

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  A return statement ends the execution of a function,
  and returns control to the calling function.
